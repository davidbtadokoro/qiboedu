    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grover algorithm is probably one of the most famous quantum computing proof of utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been known as \"Grover search algorithm\" because it is effective in a context in which we aim to find a specific solution of a problem among a set of possible solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to implement the Grover algorithm using a system of $N$ qubits in order to explore a set of $M=2^N$ possible solutions and, without going deep into the mathematical details, we will proof we need a number of Grover iterations proportional to $\\sqrt{M}$ to find the target solution with probability close to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To give the lesson a more concrete aspect, let's take a more realistic problem: \n",
    "Suppose you're at a party with $M=2^N$ friends. While you're peacefully drinking your coffee, you get distracted for a moment, and someone, without you noticing, pours sugar into your coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a disaster because you like your coffee bitter! So, you absolutely need to find the person responsible for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also suppose that there is no concrete evidence that can lead us to the guilty person, however, while poursing coffee inside your mug, the thief left a hair inside the cup, which can be used to extract DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect! we can compare the guilty DNA with that of every person who was at the party at that moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be **classically** tackled by checking all the people one by one and, in the worst case, it takes $M = 2^N$ attempts before finding the guilty person in the group. On the other hand, using quantum computing and the Grover algorithm, we will see the solution can be found with a number of algorithm's calls that scales as $\\sqrt{M}$: *we gain a quadratic speedup!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start investigating the culprit by importing some packages."

In our narrative, it can be seen as the machine which process the DNA of the people, allowing to find the guilty person. In a quantum computer notation, it is a set of operation which flips the sign of the amplitude of the state corresponding to the guilty guy (the number 11 in our case).\n",
    "4. we apply the **diffusion operator** $U_s = 2|s\\rangle \\langle s| - I$, whose effect consists in reflecting the amplitudes of the system about the average amplitude. In practice, acting together with the oracle over the superposed states, it increases the amplitude of the guilty state and decrease the one of the others.\n",
