    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life scenarios, quantum computers are imperfect and prone to noise. Some of the noise sources can be:\n",
    "- **decoerence**, which corresponds to the loss of the quantum properties of the system, usually due to some interaction with the external environment;\n",
    "- **thermal noise**, which affects in particular systems sensitive to temperature;\n",
    "- **control errors**, due to some imperfections in the laboratory tools (cables, control boards, etc.);\n",
    "- **cross-talk**, which happens when some operation we apply to a single qubit unintentionally affect the neighbouring qubits;\n",
    "- **quantum state leakage**, which is the possibility to access some undesired energy level. It can happen for example using superconducting qubits, which are in principle N-levels systems prepared to isolate the first two energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "More in general, a combination of these phenomena can affect a real quantum device, leading to a simple but relevant problem: the expected results are corrupted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `qibo`, we can simulate noisy systems and implement some strategies to take this problem into account, cleaning our results from undesired corruptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we define a simple problem, consisting in calculating the expected value of a target observable over the final state we obtain executing a quantum circuit;\n",
    "2. we compute the exact result with noiseless simulation;\n",
    "3. we add noise to the circuit and compute the noisy result;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider as an example a simple quantum system of three qubits, on which we aim to apply some rotations and then compute the expectation value of an observable composed of Pauli's."
