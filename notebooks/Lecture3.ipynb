    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first algorithms in which quantum computing has been proven to be more effective than classical computing is the Deutsch-Josza algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this algorithm is to understand if a target function $f$ is constant or balanced.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../figures/dj.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/></center>\n",
    "Since we want to use the quantum computing to tackle the problem, we use to formalize it in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. let's consider a function $f$ which takes as input a bitstring $x$ and returns one single value between zero and one: $$ f(x): \\{0,1\\}^N \\to \\{0,1\\};$$\n",
    "2. we define it constant if $f(x)=0$ or $f(x)=1$ independently of the bitstring $x$;\n",
    "3. on the other hand, we define it balanced if it returns half of the time zero and half of the time one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The main ingredients of DJ algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement the DJ algorithm considering $N$-long input bitstrings. To do this, we need to initialize an $N+1$ qubits circuit, in which the first $N$ qubits (also called **input register**) are used to encode the bitstring, while the last qubit is used as ancilla. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the input register state with $|x\\rangle$ and the ancilla state with $|y\\rangle$.\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../figures/dj-circ.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we apply the following steps:\n",
    "1. we prepare the **input register** in the $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ and the ancilla into the $|1\\rangle$;\n",
    "2. we apply an Hadamard gate to each qubit of the system, so that we create a maximally superposed state;\n",
    "3. we apply an **oracle** operation, which has to be implemented so that it represents our input string. At this stage, we can see the oracle as a black-box whose action on the system is: $$ |x\\rangle |y\\rangle \\to |x\\rangle |y \\oplus f(x)\\rangle,$$ but we are going to open the black-box later in the lecture.\n",
    "4. we apply again an Hadamard gate to each qubit of the **input register**;\n",
    "5. we measure the state of the **input register**.\n",
    "6. if the first $N$ qubits are in the $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$, the function $f$ is detected as constant, otherwise it is detected as balanced."
