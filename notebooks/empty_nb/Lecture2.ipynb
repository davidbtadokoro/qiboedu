    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to be a very short lecture, but still relevant to get familiar with one of the most simple and common tricks used in quantum computing: the phase kickback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing and implementing an example of phase kickback, we should also introduce some terminology.\n",
    "We typically refer to the main qubits of a system as the **input register** of that system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations, we could also need some more qubits, which we call **ancillas**. The **ancilla** is typically an extra qubit of your system, which can be useful for many reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../../figures/ancillas.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the phase kickback is a process in which we apply a controlled operation on a target qubit using another qubit as control, but amazingly we get a modification only in the control qubit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start importing some useful objects."

    "#### A necessary premise\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are going to see is one interesting way to apply an amplitude manipulation of the **input register** without actually apply any gate on it!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that this same effect could be obtained by directly applying some gate on the **input register**, but this example is still interesting and, moreover, it will be useful to understand more complex algorithms such as Grover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase kickback\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider two qubits: a first one is used as control, while a second is the target. An important requirement to exploit the phase kickback is that the second qubit's state is an eigenvector of the operator we aim to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase kickback implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we initialize a two qubit circuit;\n",
    "2. we apply an Hadamard gate to the first qubit, which is the **input register**, which will be the control one, and a Pauli X to the second qubit. This step will prepare the system into the state $$ |\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{|01\\rangle + |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}; $$\n",
    "3. if the state vector of the target qubit $|q_{\\rm t}\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of the chosen gate $G$, it satisfies $$ G|q_{\\rm t}\\rangle = \\lambda_G\\,|q_{\\rm t}\\rangle.$$\n",
    "4. In our case we may consider the controlled version of a $G$ gate, which has $|1\\rangle$ as eigenvector:  $$ |\\psi_2\\rangle = CG |\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{|01\\rangle + G|11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} = \n",
    "\\frac{|01\\rangle + \\lambda_{G}|11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{|0\\rangle + \\lambda_{G}|1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} \\times |1\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After step 4., the state of the control qubit has been changed, while the target one is untouched.\n",
    "\n",
